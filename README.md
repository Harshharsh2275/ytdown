# ytdown
a node based library that downloads playlist from youtube.

At the moment the user provides a link to the playlist and it downloads it, for me i think the code is useless for the general public. But, its quite useful for me and i want to further develop it. selecting region, quality for the video or downloading only the audio or just a single video file this is something i am looking to add it in future.
